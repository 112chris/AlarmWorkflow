       MaxAge:    The maximum age of operations to get. Used to limit traffic and keep the interface clean. Set to '0' for no maximum age (not recommended).
       OnlyNonAcknowledged:
                  Whether or not to limit operation retrieval to non-acknowledged operations. An operation is acknowledged after it is "done".
